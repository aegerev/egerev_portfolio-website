## Installation

No installation was required during the making of this website.

## Usage

This website contains my portfolio, in which I share facts about me, my work, my resume, and the best way(s) to contact me.

When you click on the links "About Me", "Work", and "Contact Me", they go directly to the given sections. The link to "Resume" goes to a link for my resume. (And, just as a safety measure, a link to the resume is included in the "Resume" section of the website.)

This website also provides support for mobile/tablet viewers as well - as you move the screen, everything goes along with the screen until it provides the viewer with a mobile-friendly version of the website.

The link to the deployed website is found here: https://upennbootcamp23.github.io/egerev_portfolio-website/.

## Credits

This project is my own, original work - and that's a guarantee.

However, I had help from multiple sources in order to make the website as it is today:

1. The Acceptance Criteria states "WHEN I click on the images of the applications, THEN I am taken to that deployed application." I figured out how to do this through Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2643529/add-url-link-in-css-background-image) and is displayed inside my index.html file.

2. Styling the header for the website was made possible by w3Schools (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_style_header.asp). This is shown on the top of my index.html file and on my style.css file.

3. Throughout the journey of building the website, I was helped by my instructor, Professor Anthony Maddatu. Thanks to his help, I figured out how to create the borders for the sections, and how to make the website how it is today. His help is on full display in the style.css file.

4. Throughout the journey of building the website, I was helped by my colleague, Leo. He helped me with sizing the images and making everything "professional". His help is on full display on the index.html file and the style.css file.
